# Strætó data

This repository contains data files for (hopefully) all publicly available and user contributed static data for [Strætó bs.][straeto] which provides the public transportation for the greater Reykjavík area.

## Which data is available

- [List of all stops](https://github.com/gudmundur/straeto-data/blob/master/stops/allStops.csv).
- Stops in order per direction, for all routes available in the [real-time feed][realtimefeed].
- [Rough route paths](https://github.com/gudmundur/straeto-data/blob/master/routes/route_paths.json).
- Timetables.

## Route stops

In the `stops` folder, the files are named as such

	routeNr-direction-endStop.csv

For example route 1 going from Hlemmur towards Klukkuvellir is named `1-A-Klukkuvellir.csv`.

## Route paths

The routes data is included in the `routes` folder. The format should be fairly self-explanatory but one should be aware that the data is drafted up in Google Earth so it is far from perfect.

## Schedules

The schedules from the [Strætó][straeto] website have been processed into a [computer friendly format][schedules].

Each column represents trips that are alike. The start of a trip is marked by a `0` and the consequent numbers represent how long it takes in minutes to reach that stop from the previous one.

## Timetables

In the `timetables` folder, the same naming pattern is used as for the route stops above. The timetables are generated and expanded from the schedules. 

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute data that you have, either fork this repository and send a pull request or submit an issue with whatever you have.

## License

The `allStops.csv` file was provided by Strætó bs. and the license of which is unclear, but could be published online.

The remaining data is dual licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0][cc-by-sa] and [ODbl 1.0][odbl].
